Hii! My name is Gabriella i'm 14 years old and I'm from Kenya! I'm an SDG Champion, Championing SDG 9, 14, and 15. And I really Love Animals!

My Project is a game called Rubik's cube The game is designed to help Children develop their critical thinking and problem solving skills.

I'm a kinesthetic Learner who loves creativity and innovation and would love to help other children unleash their creativity by learning how to solve puzzles.

I made my Project with HTML, CSS, Java Script and lots of patience and Hard Work!

I really Struggled with Java Script but I learnt how to be patient and Resilient.
